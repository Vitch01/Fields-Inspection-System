Based on my analysis of this app, here are the main audio communication issues that were causing inspectors to not hear coordinators, and how they were fixed:

ðŸŽ¯ Primary Issues & Solutions:
1. Mobile Data Connectivity Problem
Issue: Mobile devices couldn't establish WebRTC connections due to carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT)
Solution:

Added Twilio Network Traversal Service with dynamic TURN credentials
Enhanced TURN server configuration in client/src/lib/webrtc-utils.ts
Set iceTransportPolicy: 'all' to allow both STUN and TURN servers
2. Browser Autoplay Policy Blocking Audio
Issue: Browser autoplay policies prevented remote audio from playing
Solution:

Created dedicated hidden audio element specifically for remote audio streams
Audio element stays in DOM (required for iOS compatibility)
Enhanced audio unlocking logic with fallback retry mechanisms
3. Mobile-Specific WebSocket Issues
Issue: Mobile devices had different connection requirements
Solution:

Extended connection timeouts for mobile (15s vs 10s)
More frequent ping intervals on mobile (25s vs 30s)
Mobile device detection and adaptive configurations
4. ICE Candidate Handling Problems
Issue: Poor connection diagnostics and handling on mobile networks
Solution:

Enhanced ICE candidate logging with comprehensive diagnostics
Better connection state management and reconnection logic
ICE restart functionality for handling network changes
ðŸ”§ Key Code Areas to Fix in Your Other App:
Add TURN Server Integration:
// In your webrtc-utils.ts or similar
const iceServers = await fetchTurnCredentials(); // Get from Twilio or similar service
const configuration = {
  iceServers,
  iceTransportPolicy: 'all', // Critical for mobile
  iceCandidatePoolSize: 10
};
Create Dedicated Audio Element:
// In your WebRTC hook, when handling remote streams
if (userRole === "inspector") {
  const audioEl = document.createElement('audio');
  audioEl.autoplay = true;
  audioEl.style.position = 'absolute';
  audioEl.style.opacity = '0'; // Hidden but in DOM
  document.body.appendChild(audioEl);
  audioEl.srcObject = new MediaStream(audioTracks);
}
Mobile-Specific Configurations:
// In your WebSocket hook
const CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = isMobile ? 15000 : 10000;
const PING_INTERVAL = isMobile ? 25000 : 30000;
The main breakthrough was implementing proper TURN servers for mobile NAT traversal combined with dedicated audio element handling for browser autoplay policies.
